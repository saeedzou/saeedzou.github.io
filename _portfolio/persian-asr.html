title: "State-of-the-Art Persian Automatic Speech Recognition"
excerpt: "Developed and trained state-of-the-art models for Persian Automatic Speech Recognition, achieving a record-low 4.59% Word Error Rate (WER)â€”a 78% relative improvement over initial baselines. This work, which produced the best Persian ASR models to date, involved creating a massive 10,000-hour proprietary dataset and building scalable data processing pipelines. <br/><a href='https://huggingface.co/spaces/saeedzou/persian_asr_nemo'>Try the Demo</a><br/><img src='/images/asr.png' width='500' height='300'>"

This project showcases the development of the best-performing Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models for the Persian language.

<h3>Key achievements include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Training top-performing models like Whisper, NeMo Parakeet, and NeMo FastConformer.</li>
  <li>Achieving a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate (WER) of 4.59%, a 78% relative improvement over baselines.</li>
  <li>Curating a 10,000-hour proprietary dataset, one of the largest for the Persian language.</li>
  <li>Building scalable data processing pipelines for creating high-quality speech datasets from raw audio.</li>
</ul>

<p>The models significantly outperform previous academic and proprietary systems. A live demonstration is available on Hugging Face Spaces.</p>
