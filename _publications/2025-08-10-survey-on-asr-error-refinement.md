excerpt: 'This survey provides a structured, end-to-end map of non-intrusive ASR refinement, unifying five method classes—fusion, rescoring, correction, distillation, and training adjustment—and comparing them on practicality dimensions such as latency, trainability, and robustness. It also catalogs real-world and synthetic dataset creation pipelines, proposes a standardized metric suite that spans error-rate, language quality, and entity-specific evaluation, and analyzes domain adaptation strategies (including LLM- and RAG-based approaches). The paper concludes with open challenges around cross-modal correction, efficiency, and benchmarking to guide future work'
