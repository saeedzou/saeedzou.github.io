Welcome to my personal website. I am an AI Researcher specializing in Speech Processing, Large Language Models, and Reinforcement Learning. I am currently part of the Foundation AI Models Lab at Sharif University of Technology, where my work focuses on pushing the boundaries of speech and language technology.

My research involves developing state-of-the-art models for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and Voice Conversion (VC). I have a passion for creating large-scale, high-quality datasets and building robust, scalable AI pipelines. Some of my key projects include developing the best-performing Persian ASR models to date and creating the first bilingual Persian-English zero-shot TTS model.

Beyond my core research, I have experience as an AI consultant, applying document understanding and reinforcement learning techniques to solve real-world business challenges. I am also deeply committed to education, having served as a Head Teaching Assistant and Course Coordinator for various machine learning and deep learning courses at Sharif University.

Please feel free to explore my publications, projects, and teaching experience. You can also connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/saeedzou) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/saeed-zouashkiani).
